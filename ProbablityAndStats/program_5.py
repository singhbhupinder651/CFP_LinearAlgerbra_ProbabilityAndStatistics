    @Title: In my town, it's rainy one third of the days. Given that it is rainy, there will be heavy 
            traffic with probability 1/2, and given that it is not rainy, there will be heavy traffic 
            with probability 1/4. If it's rainy and there is heavy traffic, I arrive late for work with 
            probability 1/2. On the other hand, the probability of being late is reduced to 1/8 if it is 
            not rainy and there is no heavy traffic. In other situations (rainy and no traffic, not 
            rainy and traffic) the probability of being late is 0.25. You pick a random day.

            Write a program to find following
            a.	What is the probability that it's not raining and there is heavy traffic and I am not 
            late?
            b.	What is the probability that I am late?
            c.	Given that I arrived late at work, what is the probability that it rained that day?
